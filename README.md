# tempersensor
Another implementation to read values from TEMPer devices. 
This implementation focuses on output for MRTG and configuration through command line parameters.
Tempersensor is intended to work on OpenWRT devices, so a Makefile to compile it with OpenWRT-SDK is provided.
I would be happy if you could support me by confirming untested devices or supporting me getting your device running.
